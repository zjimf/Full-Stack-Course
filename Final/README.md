# Build your own Project

### Project requirements

- Please design a **Full Stack** web application system.

- Please plan your system interface and database design first, as well as how to communicate between programs, and **discuss the feasibility with me.**

- Please design at the side project level.（
  I want you to put it on your resume）

- Please discuss with me once production reaches a stage to avoid errors in the program direction and cannot be changed.

- Control the project duration within **20 days**, take the proposal as the first day.
- **Just give you a little pressure, I will not give suggestions after 20 days.**

- Using Github.

### Structure（Choose one）

1. MERN (MongoDB、Express、React、Node.js) -> It’s difficult but you can learn the most. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to write programs in the future.
2. React+Firebase -> I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to create a project quickly and just wants to understand the architecture.

### Function needed in your project

- Basic CRUD
- Member system
