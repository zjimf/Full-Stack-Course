# Day 18

---

Review day

- Before going to the next course, please make sure you have fully understood the previous courses, otherwise it will be difficult for you to understand later.
- You can discuss what you learned with me, or let me evaluate whether you understand the above things.
- The next step is to learn the framework, which will quickly speed up your development. However, if the foundation is not solid enough, you will be unable to debug and will never learn.
