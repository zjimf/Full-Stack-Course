## Rules

- Private, do not disclose to others.
- Unless you really encounter a big problem, try not to ask me. Solving problems by yourself is the most important skill, but it is also important to know how to set a stop loss point and ask others.
- You won’t become very good after 30 days, but you'll at least understand the architecture of how to build an entire system and know how to ask the right questions.
- Place the code you write every day in the corresponding folder and use Github to manage it
